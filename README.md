# Prediction of Sharpe ratio for blends of quantitative strategies 

Machine Learning challenge proposed by the french investment fund Napoleon X.
The challenge is organized by french ENS and Coll√®ge de France. 

Napoleon is a company specialised in designing quantitative investment solutions, i.e. investment solutions based on algorithms. While NC has developed several performing algorithms (called strategies), it aims at creating a process optimising the allocation between these algorithms.

The financial performance of a quantitative strategy can be measured by its Sharpe ratio over a period, which corresponds to its growth performance divided by its volatility on this period. As a consequence, given a set of quantitative strategies and given a period, it is almost always possible to create a linear combination of strategies (blend) whose Sharpe ratio will be better (higher) than the Sharpe ratio of each individual quantitative strategy.
